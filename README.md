1. How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

To approach designing software i try to make a check list and check off what i get done step by step. I tries to follow that method but this course was different. I had a real hard time here. Next time i will try to create more reuseable code. Als, id like to use better naming scemes, so i can easily identify different items im building.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

For this course i think i needed a new game plan. For one i need better comments. I need more detail to know what im doing ,say i come back to an assignment . Iteration played a big factor, because i wasnt thinking of how the code is goint to run step by step. I was just trying to get the main parts finished, but sometime that made the program run wonky.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science can help me reach my goal but putting me in a better position for employment. I currently work as a junior helpdesk. I would like to learn more about networking, but i think learning the ins and out of how computers process images and other things can give me a better understanding of how data is transfered.
